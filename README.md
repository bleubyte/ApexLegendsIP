# ApexLegendsIP
This was a small python script I wrote that helped me filter out bad servers on Apex legends. It works by logging the Servers IP address and adding it to a list, with the list you can use a software firewall to block those servers.

This was my workaround when playing ranked matches.

You will need to install the modules mentioned at the top of the script.
